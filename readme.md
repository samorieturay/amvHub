# AMV HUB

###### _We'll probably change the name_

AMV HUB is a central hub for people who make not only AMVs but edits in general — TikTok, YouTube, Instagram. It is a place for specialized mediums in this niche. This allows creators who may not have much reach to still be able to sell their resources. It also gives customers peace of mind, as we can review products to determine if they're safe, copyrighted, or scams.

## Ideas

- A store for all types of edits
- Any creator can upload their packs
- Customers can sort and filter all packs
- Discover popular, on-sale, or trending packs
- AI that checks and verifies reported claims
- Personalized onboarding: ask questions to build a profile and recommend packs
  - Who their favorite editors are
  - Their editing style
  - The music they listen to
  - What software they use
