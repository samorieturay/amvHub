<h1>AMV HUB</h1> 
<h6><em>We'll probably change the name</em></h6>
<br>
<p>AMVHUB is a central hub for people who make not only amvs but edits in general. Tiktok, youtube, instagram. It is a place for specialized mediums for this niche. This allows creators who do not have as much reach to still be able to sell their resources regardless of their total reach. It also gives customers a way for them to feel safe due to us being able to review such products and determine if they are safe or not, copyrighted or not, or a scam or not.</p>
<br>

<p> A store for all edits

<p> An AI that checks report claims.
<p> When customer joins, we ask them a bunch of questions to make a profile on the then suggest them packs. (Who their favorite editors are, whats their editing style, the music they listen to, what they edit on, )
